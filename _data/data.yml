    title: about me
    summary: |
      Hi, I'm a recent Computer Science graduate currently teaching programming at University and to school
      age children. I enjoy working with students, but would like to spend my remaining free time
      on more challenging projects (preferably research) that would expose me to other
      fields of science.
      I'm very enthusiastic about applying my programming and development skills
      and at the same time diversifying my knowledge in other areas.
